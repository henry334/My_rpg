Me:  Hello  madam,  could  you  tell  me  the  direction  of  the  volcano?
Unknown:  Heuu  yes,  but  why  do  you  want  to  go  there?
Me:  I  heard  of  the  legend  of  Arceus.
Unknown:  Oulaaa  I'll  stop  you  right  away.
Unknown:  You  are  getting  into  something  very  dangerous.
Me:  What  do  you  mean ?
Unknown:  Bah...  you  look  very  weak  to  cross  the  underground.
Me:  The  underground?
Unknown:  You  are  really  lost !
Unknown:  To  access  what  may  be  where  Arceus  is  being  held.
Unknown:  So  I  advise  you  to  go  for  a  little  walk
Unknown:  at  the  arena,  you  will  find  Damien  de  Bourg  Palette.
Unknown:  Try  to  defeat  it  before  embarking  on  your  journey.
Me:  That's  quite  nice.
Me:  where  do  i  find  this  shitty Damien.
Unknown:  Speaks  better  of  my  brother!!!
Unknown:  In  short,  let's  forget,  north  west  any  sailor.
Me:  NORTH  WEST  ALL  DAMIEN  I'M  COMING.
