Unknown:  Good  morning,  how  are  you  doing.
Me:  Very  well,  sorry  but  who  are  you.
Unknown:  Paul,  I'm  the  village  elder.
Me:  Oh  great,  so  do  you  know  what  pokemon  status  is
Me:  standing  at  the  entrance  of  the  village.
Paul:  It  is  a  faithful  representation  of  the  legendary  DRACAUFEU.
Paul:  A  former  trainer  named  Pierre  de  Bourg  Palette
Paul:  had  captured  her  to  defend  Mewtwo's  attack  on  the  volcano.
Paul:  But  in  reality  it's  actually  Arceus,  the  god  of  pokemon
Paul:  who  would  have  stopped  the  fight  with  his  famous  special  attack
                                                                                                JUGEMENT
Paul:  The  legend  says  that  he  would  be  locked  up  under  this  same  volcano
Paul:  But  it's  just  a  legend  ;)
Me:  But  no  one  ever  went  to  check?
Paul:  Yes,  some tried, but  oddly  we  never  saw  them  again.
Paul:  Just  a  coincidence  I  guess.
Me:  It's  all  scary.
Me:  Well,  thank  you  for  this  very  interesting  little  discussion.
Paul:  You're  welcome  young  man,  goodbye.
